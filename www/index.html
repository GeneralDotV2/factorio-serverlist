				<h3>About the mod pack (FAQ)</h3>

				<p><strong>Why can I not join <i>all</i> servers with the mod pack?</strong></p>

				<p>
				The number of servers currently online that you can join with the mod pack is less than 100%
				for two reasons: not all mods are available on the mod portal and the system cannot look into
				the future to download what will be popular when you open the page.
				</p>

				<p>
				You might also notice that the number of servers you can join does not change when you limit
				the mod pack size. This is because the mod pack consists of <i>all</i> mods that were popular
				(used by 2+ players) at any point in the past week. Many of those mods will not be used by 2+
				players at this moment.
				</p>

				<p><strong>How is the mod pack compiled?</strong></p>

				<p>
				Factorio servers are tracked 24/7. For every server with more than 1 player, its mods are
				added to a list. This keeps track of popularity. Now and then it downloads mods from the mod
				portal that it doesn't have yet.
				</p>

				<p>
				The mod pack you download is a zip file with all these mods. Any mods that are no longer
				popular are not included in the mod pack. Popularity is measured over 7 days.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Why only track servers with 2+ players?</strong></p>
				
				<p>
				It only includes servers with 2 players because empty servers are definitely not popular
				and 1 player might be the owner trying out his weird mod and is apparently also not popular.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Why only download small mods by default?</strong></p>

				<p>
				The big ones account for 60% of the size but are used on only 5% of the servers.
				(These numbers are very rough estimates.)
				</p>

				<p><strong>How does it generate dynamic zip files?</strong></p>

				<p>
				I'm glad you asked! I actually spent a few hours reading the official for ZIP file format
				documentation. The document dates back to 1989 and maintains MS DOS and Amiga. Lots of fun.
				</p>

				<p>
				Turns out, you can create zip files on the fly with no need to write a temporary file to
				disk, nor keep the whole archive in memory. Aside from about 64 bytes per file, there is
				no state to remember. Since I have the list of files already (this is in the database of
				mods), I only need to read each file part by part and forward it to the user. Still not
				terribly efficient, caching the most popular variants would be smarter, but it's a very
				good trade-off between complexity and efficiency.
				</p>

				<p>
				There are very few pieces of software that need this and the only library that I could find
				for PHP had some issues, so I looked up the spec and wrote my own.
				</p>

				<p><strong>What is wrong with the date/time in the zip?</strong></p>

				<p>
				Because of the highly advanced dynamic zip file generation&reg;, I had to write my own zip
				file generator. Turns out, zip files store their date and time in the same format as MS DOS.
				That is about as ridiculous as it sounds. I chose to skip that part.
				</p>

				<p>
				Oh and I don't store mods' metadata, so I couldn't fill the field in regardless.
				</p>

				<p><strong>How big is this mod database?</strong></p>

				<p>
				At the moment of writing, two days into collecting mods, I have about 1150 mods, taking
				2.5GB. Not a lot of new mods appear anymore. This is a bit bigger than expected, but it's
				not a problem... yet. Oh and the whole thing was monitored, rate-limited and ran at
				off-hours, so nobody had interference from me downloading this &lt;3.
