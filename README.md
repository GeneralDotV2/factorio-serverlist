# Factorio Serverlist

Unofficial serverlist for Factorio

version 0.9 (RC1)

## Installing

Clone the repository into your web server (PHP 5.4+) and modify www/config.php.
You will need a MySQL/MariaDB database.

Setup is done automatically, just open the site.

It uses only one database table called 'factorioservers', so you don't need to
create a new database if you don't want to.

## License

MIT. See the LICENSE file. Third party resources are all noted in the footer of
the website (see www/index.html).

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome! Documentation, feedback, enhancements,
refactoring, graphics, you name it.
